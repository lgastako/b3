What I want is a tool(set) that let's me:

Write down rules about how the world works and facts about the state of the
world (ala Datomic).  Rules are essentially beliefs with 100% certainty.  And
then state my belief percentages for beliefs with <100% certainty.  And then
have the system help me adjust my percentages to be consistent from a bayesian
point of view by automatically finding contradictions and helping explore and
resolve them.
