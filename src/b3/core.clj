;; The current challenge:
;; Let's create something that gives you a set of time-based datoms providing facts about the
;; state of the world, for example:
;; tN. is_raining
;; tN+1. is_not_raining
;; tN+n. sprinkler_on
;; tN+n2. sprinkler_off
;; etc
;; ala http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network

;; Then it automatically fills in the values of any not provided possible facts
;; for any new t, with a probability, first as if it did it in order, second as
;; if it knew the whole dataset in advance.

;; do we have to provide data like "was raining from time1 to time2" or can we just provide instants
;; and work it out...

;; if we work it out, would it have to be combination of time-closeness and bayes?  Well, we can
;; do bayes independent of time-closeness, then we can try to bring time-closeness into it and
;; see how we do...
